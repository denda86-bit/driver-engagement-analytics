It focuses on metrics such as active drivers, completed rides, cancellations, and gold status achievements, with the aim to provide data-driven insights and actionable business recommendations.

## Key Features

- **A/B Testing**: Evaluation of email campaigns to increase driver activity.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests to validate the impact of marketing campaigns on driver engagement.

## Objectives
